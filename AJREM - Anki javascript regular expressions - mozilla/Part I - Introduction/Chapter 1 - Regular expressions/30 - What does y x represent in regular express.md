Q: What does `(?<!y)x` represent in regular expressions?  
A: Negative lookbehind assertion. Matches "x" only if "x" is not preceded by "y."  
For example, `/(?<!-)\d+/` matches a number only if it is not preceded by a minus sign. `/(?<!-)\d+/.exec('3')` matches "3". `/(?<!-)\d+/.exec('-3')` match is not found because the number is preceded by the minus sign.
