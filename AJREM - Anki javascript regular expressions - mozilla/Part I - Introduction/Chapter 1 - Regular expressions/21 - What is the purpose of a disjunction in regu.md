Q: What is the purpose of a disjunction `|` in regular expressions?  
A: Matches either of the provided alternatives. Each component, separated by a pipe (`|`), is called an alternative.  
For example, `/green|red/` matches "green" in "green apple" and "red" in "red apple".  
> **Note:** A disjunction is another way to specify "a set of choices", but it's not a character class. Disjunctions are not atoms â€” you need to use a [group](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Regular_expressions/Groups_and_backreferences) to make it part of a bigger pattern. `[abc]` is functionally equivalent to `(?:a|b|c)`.
