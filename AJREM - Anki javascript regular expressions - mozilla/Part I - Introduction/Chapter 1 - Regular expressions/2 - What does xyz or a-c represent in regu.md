Q: What does `[^xyz]` or `[^a-c]` represent in regular expressions?  
A: A negated or complemented character class. Matches anything that is not enclosed in the brackets.  
For example, `[^abc]` is the same as `[^a-c]`. They initially match "o" in "bacon" and "h" in "chop".  
> **Note:** The ^ character may also indicate the [beginning of input](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Regular_expressions/Assertions).
