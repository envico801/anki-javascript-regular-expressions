Q: What does ` \ ` indicate in regular expressions?  
A: Indicates that the following character should be treated specially or "escaped."  
For example, `/b/` matches the character "b". By placing a backslash in front of "b", that is by using `/\b/`, the character becomes special to mean match a word boundary.  
> **Note:** To match this character literally, escape it with itself. In other words to search for ` \ ` use `/\\/`.
