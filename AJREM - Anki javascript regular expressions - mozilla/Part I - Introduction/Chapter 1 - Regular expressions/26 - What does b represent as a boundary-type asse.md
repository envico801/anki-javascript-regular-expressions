Q: What does `\B` represent as a boundary-type assertion in regular expressions?  
A: Matches a non-word boundary position where the previous and next characters are of the same type (both words or both non-words).  
For example, `/\Bon/` matches "on" in "at noon", and `/ye\B/` matches "ye" in "possibly yesterday".
